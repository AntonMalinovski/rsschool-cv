      <h3>Profile</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
		Having started my career as a commercial director in a company distributer of radio communication equipment, I became a professional in sales of B2B electronic devices.
		My interest in wireless technologies led me to work as an engineer for the technical service of radio stations, pagers and radio modems.
		<br>
		<br>
		I also combined the work of an advertising agent, planning advertising campaigns, making up layouts of ads for newspapers. Having independently studied HTML and PHP, Photoshop and CorelDRAW created a network of sites running on a single engine.
		<br>
		<br>
		Remote work gives me extra free time, which I spend studying Frontend development.
		I am interested in web development because this profession offers promising opportunities for building communications with the client, and CRM automation and NLP technologies allow us to interact with the consumer much more effectively.
		<br>
		<br>
		I believe that my knowledge and experience, as well as the ability to learn and acquire new skills, will help me go this way and become an experienced interface developer.
